  abstract  = "One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery.\nConcerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.\nReproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.",

abstract = {Turbomole is a highly optimized software package for large-scale quantum chemical simulations of molecules, clusters, and periodic solids. Turbomole uses Gaussian basis sets and specializes on predictive electronic structure methods with excellent cost to performance characteristics, such as (time-dependent) density functional theory (TDDFT), second-order MÃ¸llerâ€“Plesset theory, and explicitly correlated coupled cluster (CC) methods. These methods are combined with ultraefficient and numerically stable algorithms such as integral-direct and Laplace transform methods, resolution-of-the-identity, pair natural orbitals, fast multipole, and low-order scaling techniques. Apart from energies and structures, a variety of optical, electric, and magnetic properties are accessible from analytical energy derivatives for electronic ground and excited states. Recent additions include post-Kohnâ€“Sham calculations within the random phase approximation, periodic calculations, spinâ€“orbit couplings, explicitly correlated CC singles doubles and perturbative triples methods, CC singles doubles excitation energies, and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations using TDDFT. A dedicated graphical user interface and a user support network are also available. This article is categorized under: Software > Quantum Chemistry},

abstract={Noncovalent interactions govern many important areas of chemistry, ranging from biomolecules to molecular crystals. Here, an accurate and computationally inexpensive dispersion-corrected second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory model (MP2D) is presented. MP2D recasts the highly successful dispersion-corrected MP2C model in a framework based on Grimme's D3 dispersion correction, combining Grimme's D3 dispersion coefficients with new analogous uncoupled Hartree-Fock ones and five global empirical parameters. MP2D is faster than MP2C, and unlike MP2C, it is suitable for geometry optimizations and can describe both intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions with high accuracy. MP2D approaches the accuracy of higher-level ab initio wave function techniques and out-performs a widely used hybrid dispersion-corrected density functional on a range of intermolecular, intramolecular, and thermochemical benchmarks.},

      Kohnâ€“Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding
      higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism.
      The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion
      coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first
      principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are
      computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry)
      dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type
      approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers
      (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of
      atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires
      adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is
      asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and
      easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity
      terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark
      sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a
      particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy
      element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set
      of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease
      by 15\%â€“40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D
      version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding
      model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the
      long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also
      lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown
      for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface.
      For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms
      substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose
      the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the
      dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and
      related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems."

In this paper{,} we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space{,} a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1{,} which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H{,} C{,} N{,} and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces{,} we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies{,} we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set."}

      investigated the PES by a combination of molecular dynamics/quenching
      procedures with high-level correlated ab initio calculations. We found
      that neither empirical potentials nor various DFT functionals provide
      satisfactory results. On the other hand, the approximative DFT method
      covering the dispersion energy yields a reliable set of the most stable
      structures, which we subsequently investigated with an accurate,
      correlated ab initio treatment. The global minimum contains three
      moderately strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds and is mainly stabilized
      by London dispersion forces between the phenyl ring, the carboxylic acid
      group, and various peptide bonds. A proper description of the last type
      of interaction requires accurate correlated ab initio calculations,
      including the complete basis set limit of the MP2 method and CCSD(T)
      correction terms. Since in our beam experiments the conformations are
      frozen by cooling from a higher temperature, it is necessary to localize
      the most stable structures on the free-energy surface rather than on the
      PES. We used two different procedures (rigid rotor/harmonic
      oscillator/ideal gas approximation based on ab initio characteristics
      and evaluation of relative populations from the molecular dynamic
      simulations using the AMBER potential) and both yield four structures,
      the global minimum and three local minima. These four structures were
      among the 15 most energetically stable structures obtained from accurate
      ab initio optimization. The calculated IR spectra for these four
      structures agree well with the experimental frequencies, which validates
      the localization procedure."

      The data thus obtained were used to assess the performance of a variety
      of density functional methods. Double-hybrid functionals like B2GP-PLYP
      and B2K-PLYP, especially with a small Grimme-type empirical dispersion
      correction, are capable of rendering conformational energies of CCSD(T)
      quality. These were used as a secondary standard for a larger sample of
      alkanes, including isopentane and the branched hexanes as well as key
      isomers of heptane and octane. Popular DFT functionals like B3LYP,
      B3PW91, BLYP, PBE, and PBE0 tend to overestimate conformer energies
      without dispersion correction, while the M06 family severely
      underestimates GG interaction energies. Grimme-type dispersion
      corrections for these overcorrect and lead to qualitatively wrong
      conformer orderings. All of these functionals also exhibit deficiencies
      in the conformer geometries, particularly the backbone torsion angles.
      The PW6B95 and, to a lesser extent, BMK functionals are relatively free
      of these deficiencies. Performance of these methods is further
      investigated to derive conformer ensemble corrections to the enthalpy
      function, {$H_{298} - H_{0}$}, and the Gibbs energy function, gef(T) $=
      - [G(T) - H_0(T)]/T$, of these alkanes. These are essential for accurate
      computed heats of formation of especially the larger species as the
      corrections for these are several times the expected uncertainty in
      modern computational thermochemistry methods such as W4 theory. While
      {$H_{298} - H_{0}$} is only moderately sensitive to the level of theory,
      gef(T) exhibits more pronounced sensitivity. Once again, double hybrids
      acquit themselves very well. The effects of zero-point energy and
      nonfactorizable rovibrational partition functions have been

      energies between chemical fragments comprising a protein-ligand complex.
      An HIV-II protease crystal structure with a bound ligand (indinavir) was
      chosen as a model protein-ligand complex. The complex was decomposed
      into 21 interacting fragment pairs, which were studied using a number of

      coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)/CBS) interaction energies were used as

      was surprising, especially for parametrized classical and semiempirical
      quantum mechanical calculations. After propagating these fragment-based
      error estimates over the entire protein-ligand complex, our total error
      estimates for many methods are large compared to the experimentally

      Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation

      term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction
      energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ).
      Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental
      ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the
      chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational
      methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22)
      containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger
      basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T)
      and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes

      common to estimate interaction energies at the complete basis set (CBS)
      coupled-cluster through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory
      by adding to CBS second-order perturbation theory (MP2) a
      coupled-cluster correction, $\delta^{CCSD(T)}_{MP2}$, evaluated in a
      modest basis set. This work illustrates that commonly used basis sets
      such as 6-31G*(0.25) can yield large, even wrongly signed, errors for
      $\delta^{CCSD(T)}_{MP2}$ that vary significantly by binding motif.
      Double-zeta basis sets show more reliable results when used with
      explicitly correlated methods to form a $\delta^{CCSD(T*)}_{MP2-F12}$
      correction, yielding a mean absolute deviation of 0.11 kcal mol$^{-1}$
      for the S22 test set. Examining the coupled-cluster correction for basis
      sets up to sextuple-zeta in quality reveals that delta(CCSD(T))(MP2)
      converges monotonically only beyond a turning point at triple-zeta or
      quadruple-zeta quality. In consequence, CBS extrapolation of
      $\delta^{CCSD(T)}_{MP2}$ corrections before the turning point, generally
      CBS (aug-cc-pVDZ,aug-cc-pVTZ), are found to be unreliable and often
      inferior to aug-cc-pVTZ alone, especially for hydrogen-bonding systems.
      Using the findings of this paper, we revise some recent benchmarks for
      non-covalent interactions, namely the S22, NBC10, HBC6, and HSG test
      sets. The maximum differences in the revised benchmarks are 0.080,
      0.060, 0.257, and 0.102 kcal mol$^{-1}$, respectively."

abstract={One of the grand challenges in modern theoretical chemistry is designing and implementing approximations that expedite ab initio methods without loss of accuracy. Machine learning (ML) methods are emerging as a powerful approach to constructing various forms of transferable atomistic potentials. They have been successfully applied in a variety of applications in chemistry, biology, catalysis, and solid-state physics. However, these models are heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data used in their fitting. Fitting highly flexible ML potentials, such as neural networks, comes at a cost: a vast amount of reference data is required to properly train these models. We address this need by providing access to a large computational DFT database, which consists of more than 20 M off equilibrium conformations for 57,462 small organic molecules. We believe it will become a new standard benchmark for comparison of current and future methods in the ML potential community.},

abstract={Computational de novo design of new drugs and materials requires rigorous and unbiased exploration of chemical compound space. However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.},

Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in understanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol-1) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.},

ML molecular predictions have been recently published with an accuracy on par with Density Functional Theory calculations. Such ML models need to be tested and generalized on real data. PC9, a new QM9 equivalent dataset (only H, C, N, O and F and up to 9 "heavy" atoms) of the PubChemQC project is presented in this article. A statistical study of bonding distances and chemical functions shows that this new dataset encompasses more chemical diversity. Kernel Ridge Regression, Elastic Net and the Neural Network model provided by SchNet have been used on both datasets. The overall accuracy in energy prediction is higher for the QM9 subset. However, a model trained on PC9 shows a stronger ability to predict energies of the other dataset.},

It is composed of five databases taken from literature (GMTKN, MGCDB84, Minnesota2015, DP284, and W4-17), two newly developed reaction energy databases (W4-17-RE and MN-RE), and a new collection of databases containing transition metals.

SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.",

  abstract  = "One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery.\nConcerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.\nReproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.",
